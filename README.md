# Featuretoggle
A simple, lightweight feature toggle framework for ABAP

## What is it?
With this framework you can toggle features in ABAP-Code at runtime. This enables you to continuously deliver (potentially unfinished)Features in a deactivated state into the production system. This repository includes the ABAP backend and a UI5 GUI to manage featurestates.

## Requirements
* SAP 7.4
* [abapGit](https://github.com/larshp/abapGit)
* Eclipse + UI5/ADT Tools

## How to run it?
1. Create a new ABAP class which inherits the class z_sy_feature (see examples/z_xx_feature.abap).
2. Define new feature via class attribute 
3. Toggle feature via the transaktion z_sy_feature (opens UI5 frontend)
4. Check if feature is enabled by checking if z_sy_feature=>feature_xx = abap_true 

:warning: features should never be enabled in production system!

### Examples
